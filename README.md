Grow-Lite is a fun, digestable source to learn how to grow vegetables in your own backyard!

## Motivation

We felt that people generally are interested in growing home-grown-food, but that many of the sources to learn such a skill are too dense. We wanted to create a platform for users to access growing information on their favorite vegetables in a way that was appealing and explanatory, but not overwhelming.

## Technology

**Built with:**

* Javascript
* Ruby on Rails

## Features

* Users can select veggies that they are interested in learning to grow

* Users can click on a specific vegetable panel to see the information about that vegetable
* Users can also sign in to add helpful tips for other users
